//STEP 1 NUMBER OF DAYS IN THE MONTH
/*var d = new Date();
window.console.log(d.getDate());*/

//STEP 2 Create an application that gets the month name from a particular date. Display that result within the console window.
var d = new Date("09–02-12");
window.console.log(d);


//STEP 3.	Create an application that tests whether a date is a weekend. Display that result within the console window

//STEP 4 Create an application that gets yesterday’s day of the week. For instance, if today is Tuesday, the console window should display Monday

//STEP 5 Create an application that gets the current day of the week. The twist here is that I want only the first letter of the day. If today is Tuesday, the letter T should be displayed in the console window.
